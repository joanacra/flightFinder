# Flight Finder

Tool to find flights by departure/destination airport in a range of dates up to a max price.

Will be using Ryanair's public API for flight search (https://gist.github.com/vool/bbd64eeee313d27a82ab)

https://services-api.ryanair.com/farfnd/3/oneWayFares - one way flights

https://services-api.ryanair.com/farfnd/3/roundTripFares - roundtrip flights

Both endpoints take query parameters that can be found on the gist linked above.
